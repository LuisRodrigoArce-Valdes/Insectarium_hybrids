### Heliconius butterflies insectarium project

Welcome to the repository for the analysys of butterfly species within the "Insectarium de Montréal".

In this repository you will find all data, scripts and results developed to assess the genetic distance (measured as COI gene substitutions) between all possible pair of species of the "Insectarium de Montréal".

Feel free to navigate to the following directories:

- data: Here you will find the raw database of lepidopteran species in the insectarium and intermediary files will be saved (these have been .gitignored though).
- bin: you will have access to all the scripts used to download all publicly available COI sequences in the BOLD database, the alignments of all of them per species and the estimation of genetic divergence between all possible pair of species within each genus.
- results: here it's where the final results and plots are saved. You can see these results immediately if you have downloaded (or git -cloned) this repository from github!

Best!
Luis :)
